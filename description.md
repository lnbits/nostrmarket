> IMPORTANT: Nostr market needs the nostr-client extension installed.

Buy and sell things over Nostr, using NIP15 https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/15.md

Nostr was partly based on the the previous version of this extension "Diagon Alley", so lends itself very well to buying and sellinng over Nostr.

The Nostr Market extension includes:

- A merchant client to manage products, sales and communication with customers.
- A customer client to find and order products from merchants, communicate with merchants and track status of ordered products.

All communication happens over NIP04 encrypted DMs.
